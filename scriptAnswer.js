 * 1. Create variables to represent scores of exams for Matt and Simon and set values 80 and 45;
 * 
 * 2. Create variable to set the lower limit for passing an exam and assign to it value as 51;
 * 
 * 3. Write the condition in if statement, which will check if both students have passed an 
 * exam and log the result in console;
 * 
 * 4. Use else if statement in order to check if one of the students has passed an exam and 
 * log the result in console;
 * 
 * 5. Use else statement in order to display in console that both students have failed;
 * 
 * 6. In case of passing the exam by one of the students, find out which one was that and 
 * display in console as an additional information the student name and his points
 * 
 * 7. Test all the possible cases (a. both students passed; b. Matt passed and Simon 
 * failed; c. Simon passed and Matt failed; d. both students failed).

  *  1. Create an array - students, insert four items, which should be objects 
  *  and have three properties: name, score1, score2, with the following values:
  *          a. John, 47, 46
  *          b. Bob, 23, 24
  *          c. Nick, 40, 35
  *          d. Alex, 44, 45
  * 
  *  2. Suppose that, students have chance to get different degrees of diploma, 
  *  like A, B, C, D, E and those degrees are relevant
  *  to the following passing limits 91, 81, 71, 61, 51. 
  *  According to that, create two arrays for passing limits and for degrees
  * 
  *  3. Create function which will calculate total score (score1 + score2) for each student.
  * 
  *  4. Create function and use in it for loops, if else statements and whatever 
  *  you need, in order to figure out, which student has passed an exam and what 
  *  kind of degree he has got.
  * 
  *  5. Display the final result in console.
